# CSC8501-AdvancedProgramming
This project is entirely my own work. This was to solve a problem regarding polynomial equations. 
The program can generate polynomials according to some specifications in the readme, it can generate a set of outputs for a range of x values. 
It can save and load output set and regenerate the polynomial equation used to generate them.

The highest degree of each variable is 4, the constant is 1000 and each coefficient is 9. (This include negatives)
There can only be a maximum of 4 terms

Example:

4x^2 * 2x + 199
